Kubernetes YAML template for a **Deployment** object with all critical configurations and detailed comments:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1 # Specifies the API version used for the Deployment object
kind: Deployment   # Defines the type of resource; here it is a Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment # Name of the Deployment; should be unique within the namespace
  namespace: default  # Namespace in which the Deployment is created
  labels:
    app: my-app # Labels to organize and identify the Deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3 # Number of Pod replicas to be maintained by the Deployment
  selector:
    matchLabels: # Defines the Pod labels the Deployment should manage
      app: my-app # Ensure this matches the labels in the Pod template below
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate # Specifies how Pods are updated; can be RollingUpdate or Recreate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1 # Maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during updates
      maxSurge: 1       # Maximum number of extra Pods created during updates
  template: # Template for the Pods that the Deployment creates
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app # Labels applied to Pods created by this Deployment; must match selector
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container # Name of the container within the Pod
          image: nginx:1.21.6 # Image used for the container; ensure the correct version is specified
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80 # Port exposed by the container
          resources: # Resource requests and limits for the container
            requests:
              memory: "64Mi"  # Minimum memory required for the container
              cpu: "250m"     # Minimum CPU required for the container
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi" # Maximum memory the container can use
              cpu: "500m"     # Maximum CPU the container can use
          livenessProbe: # Liveness probe to check if the container is running
            httpGet:
              path: /         # Path to send HTTP GET requests
              port: 80        # Port for the HTTP GET requests
            initialDelaySeconds: 5 # Time before the first probe after container start
            periodSeconds: 10      # Interval between probes
          readinessProbe: # Readiness probe to check if the container is ready to serve traffic
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 80
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 10
          env: # Environment variables for the container
            - name: ENVIRONMENT
              value: production
          volumeMounts: # Mount volumes into the container
            - name: config-volume
              mountPath: /etc/config
      volumes: # Define the volumes to be used
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: my-config-map # Reference to a ConfigMap

### Key Explanations
1. **Metadata**:
   - **`name`**: Name of the Deployment.
   - **`namespace`**: Namespace where the Deployment is created.
   - **`labels`**: Helps organize and identify resources.

2. **Spec**:
   - **`replicas`**: Specifies the desired number of Pods.
   - **`selector.matchLabels`**: Matches Pods based on labels.
   - **`strategy`**:
     - **`type`**: `RollingUpdate` ensures zero downtime updates; `Recreate` stops all Pods before recreating them.
     - **`maxUnavailable`/`maxSurge`**: Balances availability and update speed.

3. **Template**:
   - **`metadata.labels`**: Labels assigned to the Pods created by the Deployment.
   - **`containers`**:
     - **`name`**: Name of the container.
     - **`image`**: Docker image to be deployed.
     - **`ports`**: Ports exposed by the container.
     - **`resources`**: Resource limits and requests to ensure fair usage.
     - **`probes`**: Liveness and readiness checks for the container.
   - **`env`**: Sets environment variables for the container.
   - **`volumeMounts`/`volumes`**: Connects the container to persistent storage or configurations.

### Customization
- Replace `my-deployment`, `my-app`, `nginx:1.21.6`, and other values with your app-specific settings.
- Add or remove probes and resource settings as needed for your application's requirements.
