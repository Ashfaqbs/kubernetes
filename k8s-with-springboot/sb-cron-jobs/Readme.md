# Cron jobs
- In real time task scheduling is an essential aspect of managing the recurring jobs or automated  the process to handle the recurring jobs.

for example:

![alt text](image.png)

![alt text](image-1.png)

## Code 
- A spring application which reads a csv file and processes it and sends in a mail for every 2 mins 
- The schedule is set to run every 2 mins and is achieved by the scheduler.
![alt text](image-2.png)
- We are not exposing any service or endpoint from this application.
- We will remove the line ```	@Scheduled(cron = "0 */2 * * * *")``` as we will not schedule from the app but we will
schedule it from K8s and we will define the function there.
- How k8s will call this function is running the main class of the application

```
@SpringBootApplication

public class SbCronjobAppApplication implements CommandLineRunner {
	
	  @Autowired
	    private ReportGenerationScheduler scheduler;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SbCronjobAppApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Override
	public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
		scheduler.generateReportAndSendEmail();
	}
}
```

- Start the minikube and refer to docker-env.
- Create the docker image for the application.
- Dockerfile
```
# Use an Alpine-based JDK 17 as the base image
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Expose the port your application will listen on
EXPOSE 8080

# Copy the JAR into /app and rename it to app.jar
ADD target/sb-cron-app.jar /app/app.jar

# Define the entry point command to run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]


```

- Verify the image 
```

## Observation:
Every time the cron schedule triggers (e.g., every two minutes), Kubernetes creates a new Pod. This new Pod runs your application, and since your Spring Boot app is designed to execute the function once on startup, the function gets called every time the Pod is created. 


1. **Handling Overlapping Pods**: By default, Kubernetes allows Pods to overlap, meaning if the previous Pod is still running when the next CronJob is triggered, the new Pod will still start. However, we can control this behavior using the `concurrencyPolicy` field in the CronJob YAML:
   - **Forbid**: Ensures that if a previous Pod is still running, the next scheduled job won't start.
   - **Replace**: Stops the currently running Pod and replaces it with a new one.

2. **Pod Lifecycle**: Once a Pod completes its execution (i.e., our application finishes its one-time function call), it moves to the `Completed` state. However, it remains in the cluster unless explicitly cleaned up. To avoid resource consumption:
   - Use `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` and `failedJobsHistoryLimit` to automatically delete old job metadata after a certain number of jobs.
   - Set `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` to define how long Kubernetes should keep the Pod after it finishes. For example, `ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 60` will delete the Pod one minute after it completes.

3. **Resource Consumption**: To optimize resource usage:
   - Set `restartPolicy: Never` in the Job spec, so the Pod won't restart on failure.
   - Ensure that resource requests/limits are defined in the YAML, so the Pod doesnâ€™t consume unnecessary CPU or memory.

eg YAML
```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: example-cronjob
spec:
  # Schedule the job to run every 2 minutes
  schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
  
  # Concurrency policy to forbid overlapping runs (i.e., only one pod running at a time)
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  
  # How many successful jobs to keep in the history
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3
  
  # How many failed jobs to keep in the history
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1

  # How long to keep the Pod after it finishes (TTL for completed Pods)
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 60  # Delete the Pod 1 minute after completion

  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: your-springboot-app
            # Define the Docker image to use for the Pod
            image: your-docker-image
            command: ["java", "-jar", "your-app.jar"]  # The command to run in the container
            resources:
              # Define resource requests and limits
              requests:
                memory: "64Mi"
                cpu: "250m"
              limits:
                memory: "128Mi"
                cpu: "500m"
          restartPolicy: Never  # Don't restart the Pod once it finishes

```

Excellent question, Mohammed Ashfaq! Let's break it down step by step:

### How Kubernetes Knows When a Container Is Completed

1. **Container Exit Code**:
   - When the application (inside the container) completes its execution, the container process exits with an **exit code**. 
   - If the process completes successfully, it typically exits with `exit code 0`.
   - Kubernetes monitors the container's status and checks the exit code to determine if it finished successfully.

2. **Pod Phase Tracking**:
   - Kubernetes tracks the lifecycle of a Pod. Once the container inside the Pod completes, the Pod moves to the `Succeeded` or `Failed` phase based on the exit code.
   - If a Pod reaches the `Succeeded` phase, Kubernetes considers the Pod's job done.

3. **Job and CronJob Behavior**:
   - For a **Job** (or CronJob), Kubernetes relies on the Pod's `Succeeded` status to know the task is complete.
   - The CronJob's `concurrencyPolicy` (e.g., `Forbid`) ensures that if a job's Pod hasn't completed, Kubernetes won't start a new Pod for the next Cron trigger.

### In Our Case: The Spring Boot Application Inside the Container

When we containerize our Spring Boot application:
1. The logic (e.g., calling a function on application start) runs **once** when the application starts.
2. Once the logic completes, the `java` process inside the container exits with a status code of `0`.
3. Kubernetes detects the container's exit status and marks the Pod as `Succeeded`.

If the Pod finishes before the next CronJob schedule, Kubernetes is ready to create a new Pod. However:
- If the Pod is still running, the `concurrencyPolicy` (e.g., `Forbid`) ensures no new Pod starts until the running one finishes.

### Example Workflow:
1. **Cron Schedule**: The CronJob is set to run every 2 minutes.
2. **Pod Lifecycle**:
   - At `T=0`: Kubernetes starts a Pod.
   - The Pod runs the containerized Spring Boot application.
   - The application calls the function once and exits.
   - Kubernetes marks the Pod as `Succeeded`.
3. **Next Run**:
   - At `T=2`: Kubernetes starts a new Pod, repeating the process.

If the first Pod hasnâ€™t completed by `T=2`:
- If `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid`, the new job wonâ€™t start.
- If `concurrencyPolicy: Allow`, Kubernetes will create a new Pod regardless of the previous one.

### Key Insight:
Kubernetes doesnâ€™t care about whatâ€™s inside the container; it only looks at the processâ€™s exit status and Pod lifecycle state to manage CronJob executions.

          restartPolicy: Never  # Don't restart the Pod once it completes or fails
```

### Breakdown of Key Sections:
1. **`schedule`**: Defines when the job should run using a cron expression. For example, `"*/2 * * * *"` runs the job every 2 minutes.
2. **`concurrencyPolicy`**: Controls how Kubernetes handles overlapping job executions.  
   - `Forbid`: Prevents new jobs from starting if the previous one hasnâ€™t finished.
   - `Replace`: Stops the running job and starts a new one.
   - `Allow`: Allows multiple jobs to run in parallel.
3. **`successfulJobsHistoryLimit`**: Limits the number of successful job records to keep.
4. **`failedJobsHistoryLimit`**: Limits the number of failed job records to keep.
5. **`ttlSecondsAfterFinished`**: Automatically deletes the Pod after it finishes, helping clean up resources.
6. **`jobTemplate`**: Defines the Pod template, specifying the container (your Spring Boot application), command to run, and resource limits.
   - `resources.requests`: What Kubernetes should reserve for the Pod to run (memory and CPU).
   - `resources.limits`: The maximum allowed resource usage for the Pod.

### Additional Notes:
- **Image**: The Docker image for your Spring Boot app (e.g., `your-docker-image`).
- **Resources**: This section helps manage the Podâ€™s resource consumption (like CPU and memory).
- **restartPolicy: Never**: Ensures that Kubernetes doesnâ€™t try to restart the Pod once itâ€™s completed, keeping it idle until the next CronJob trigger.
