## TCP vs UDP In K8s:

 - When you define a **Kubernetes Service**, choosing **TCP** or **UDP** depends on what kind of communication your application needs. The protocol decides **how data flows** between clients and the pods behind the Service.

### **Why TCP in Kubernetes Services?**
Most applications require **reliable communication**, so **TCP** is the default. Here's why you'd use TCP:  
- **APIs and Web Applications**: When a client makes an HTTP or HTTPS request to a backend API, the data must arrive reliably and in order. For example:  
  - You make a POST request to a user-registration API.  
  - The server must receive your full JSON payload (e.g., `{name: "Ashfaq"}`) without missing parts. TCP ensures this.  
- **Databases**: Services like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB use TCP because losing or misordering packets can corrupt the data being written or retrieved.  
- **Critical Systems**: Any application where losing data or sending it in the wrong order would break functionality needs TCP.

### **Why UDP in Kubernetes Services?**
UDP is used when **speed and low latency** matter more than reliability. You’d choose UDP in these cases:  
- **Video Streaming**: For example, a video streaming service hosted on Kubernetes doesn’t need to retransmit every dropped frame. As long as most data arrives on time, the video will play smoothly.  
- **Gaming Servers**: Multiplayer game servers often use UDP to send quick updates about player positions. Missing one or two updates doesn’t matter because new updates will come quickly.  
- **DNS**: DNS lookups often use UDP because they’re small and can tolerate the occasional dropped packet.

### **How It Works in Kubernetes?**
1. **TCP Example**:  
   - If you're deploying a Spring Boot application that exposes an API (e.g., `/api/users`), the Kubernetes Service object will use TCP because HTTP runs on TCP.  
   - Example YAML:  
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: user-api-service
     spec:
       selector:
         app: user-api
       ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
       type: ClusterIP
     ```
  
2. **UDP Example**:  
   - If you're deploying a game server (e.g., for a multiplayer game), you might define the Service to use UDP.  
   - Example YAML:  
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: game-server-service
     spec:
       selector:
         app: game-server
       ports:
       - protocol: UDP
         port: 1234
         targetPort: 1234
       type: ClusterIP
     ```

### **When Do You Define TCP or UDP in Kubernetes?**
You define it based on **what protocol the application uses**:  
- Use **TCP** when the application demands reliability (e.g., APIs, databases).  
- Use **UDP** when low latency is more important (e.g., streaming, gaming).  

Kubernetes just routes traffic; the protocol ensures that it’s handled correctly for the application's needs.
